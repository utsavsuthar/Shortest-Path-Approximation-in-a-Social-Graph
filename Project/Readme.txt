First run the GraphPartition.py. it will simply find graph 100 landmark node and assign each node to one of the landmarknode. 
Also it will generate 1000 random pairs of node for which we need to find the path. 

Then Run 23CS60R49_Assignment8.c file. I have implemented two threads, graph_update threads & path_finder threads.
